# Double SHA256 Optimization Project

This project aims to improve the performance of the double SHA256 algorithm used in Bitcoin mining by adding several optimizations and ASIC boost support. The optimizations implemented in this project are intended to reduce the time and energy required to perform the SHA256 hashing operations.
